# .NET Core 8 Project with DevExpress Dasboard (Cusom Gallery Item) and DevExtreme Controls

DevExtreme Controls and DevExpress Dashboard Custom Item Gallery were used in the same .NET Core 8 project.
I used these official DevExpress project as references:

1. the project template ["DevExtreme 24.1 Asp.Net Core Application"](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/401026/devextreme-based-controls/get-started/configure-a-visual-studio-project) in Visual Studio 2022
2. [DevExpress ASP.NET Core Custom Item Gallery](https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/asp-net-core-dashboard-custom-item-gallery?tab=readme-ov-file)

View/Home/Index.cshtml displays DevExtreme Control (DataGrid) and Custom Dashboard.

### WARNING:
wwwroot/js/devextreme is ***not*** included in the repository, so you should add it yourself.
